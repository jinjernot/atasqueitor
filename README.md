I developed a tool to automate the time-consuming task of cleaning up Excel reports for HP's product management team. The tool uses Pandas to load and clean two types of reports from the HP product content database, eliminating unnecessary data and formatting the remaining information in an easy-to-read manner for the PMs.

By automating this process, I have significantly reduced the time and effort required for manual cleanup, allowing the PMs to focus on more strategic tasks. This repository contains the code for this tool, which is currently in version 1.0.

I invite you to explore the code and see for yourself the potential benefits of automation for your organization. Please feel free to provide feedback or suggestions for further development. Thank you for your interest in this project.
